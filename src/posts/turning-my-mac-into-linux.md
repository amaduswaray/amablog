## TLDR

Alt title: Fixing macos to be more develper friendly

MacOS is a great operating system for most people, however, there are certain things that can elevate experience of the operating systems. Emulating features such as tiling window managers, app launchers and custimization can make your MacOS experience more unique and plesant.

In the blog I showcase how I use tools like [aerospace](), [sketchybar](), [raycast]() to get a better MacOS experience.

## Background

This journey started started in 2020 when I got caught in config and productivity hell. This was a phase where I would spend time looking for newer and better productivity tools, instead of actually being productive. By 2022 I became satisfied with how I had my mac setup. I used Raycast as an app launcher, Rectangle as window manager, neovim as an editor, and my browser was SigmaOS. The main theme of this setup was that I used my keyboard to navigate everything. One thing I realised is that I would always setup the same workspaces and i would have to repeat them everytime i rebooted my macbook. This became tedious and i started looking at other options. And by 2023 I had my perfect setup which i use to this day.

## The appeal of linux

Linux has countless benifits, more than what i am aware of. But the things that made linux appealing to me was the tiling window managers and the customization. Having a keyboard only workflow reduced a lot of the cognetive load of having to search for things i wanted to do on my computer. So my goal here was to customize my mac so that it gives enough context clues for my workflow, whilest also alowing me to do what i need with only the keyboard.

## Why MacOS

One might ask themselves why go through the trouble of emulating the Linux experience on MacOS, instead of simply using Linux.

Well, this basically comes down to app support and the Apple ecosystem. I own multiple apple devices, which makes my setup quite convenient. And MacOS has the benefit of getting a lot of developer app support first, and because it's Unix based, many CLI tools are often available on MacOS.

I do think that if not for the software that has been made on macos over the years, i probably would have moved on to Linux.

## Showcase

Here is a walkthrough of how i use my setup.

I use aerospace as my tiling window manager. With this i have 8 worspaces defined for developement, my browser, calander, music, mail, etc. Navigating between these are only a click away.

Initally, i was drawn to sketchybar to give my menu bar more context clues. But the macos 26 menu bar removed the blur effect, and all i really need to see on my screen is which app is currently active, which workspace im on and what my input language is
