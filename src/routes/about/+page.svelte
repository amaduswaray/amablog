		<p class="mb-2">
			I’m an avid <span class="font-medium text-pink-300">Vim</span> user and enjoy crafting custom configurations
			to boost my workflow. Over time, I’ve gravitated away from traditional desktop and mobile apps,
			preferring to accomplish tasks directly in the terminal.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-2">
			I earned my <span class="font-medium">BSc in Informatics</span> from the
			<span class="font-medium text-pink-300">University of Oslo</span>, where I specialized in
			<span class="italic">algorithms: design and efficiency</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For my master's, I joined the <span class="font-medium">Network and Distributed Systems</span>
			research group. My thesis explored accelerating machine learning inference by moving computation
			to the network using dedicated Data Processing Units (DPUs).

		<p class="mb-2">
			I'm currently a developer at <span class="font-medium text-pink-300">Orgbrain</span>, mainly
			working on web development. Outside of work, I’m diving into systems programming and creating

		<h2 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold">Beyond Code</h2>
		<p class="mb-2">
			Outside of programming, I enjoy listening to music and discovering new genres and artists.
			Cooking is another love of mine — there’s something incredibly satisfying about experimenting
			in the kitchen. Lately, I’ve also taken an interest in reading as a way to unplug from social
			media and recharge.
