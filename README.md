# Amadu’s and Don’ts 🧠💻

Welcome to **Amadu’s and Don’ts** — my corner of the internet where I write about the tech I love, the tools I try (and abandon), and the lessons I pick up along the way.

This blog is less about hot takes and more about honest reflections. Expect thoughts on frameworks, functional programming, side project struggles, and everything in between.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- Posts about web development, JavaScript, and modern frameworks
- Rants and reflections from a recovering framework hoarder
- Notes-to-self disguised as blog posts
- Experiments, code snippets, and maybe even a meme or two

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) – lightweight, powerful, and just the right amount of magic
- Markdown files – because plain text never goes out of style

## 🚀 Getting Started (for the curious)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/amadu-and-donts.git
cd amadu-and-donts
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
